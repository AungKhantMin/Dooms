We all know that we don't have anything to do so much. You all have to study two chapters a week and do all the exercises and commit to your brunch. That is our first goal.

For the second goal, you guys have to make familiar with kali linux. all of you can ask me about everything anytime cause i am almost always online. Make familiar with terminal especially and commands. Then read online about famous tools like nmap,metasploit,gobuster,hydra and learn how to use them
